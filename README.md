## Set up

You can install the required dependencies by running:

`npm install`


## Running tests

After all dependencies are installed, you can run all the unit tests by running:

`npm run test`

If you want to run a particular test (for just one exercise), you need to add the route to the folder where the test is located, using package.json as reference. i.e:

`npm run test 02-loops-data-structures/can-i-order-item`
